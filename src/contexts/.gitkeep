# Contexts

This folder contains React Context API contexts for managing global application state.
Use this folder for contexts that need to be shared across multiple components.

## Organization Guidelines

- Create separate files for each context domain or feature
- Use descriptive names: `auth-context.tsx`, `theme-context.tsx`, `user-context.tsx`
- Group related contexts together if they share similar concerns
- Each context file should export both the context and its provider component
