# Providers

This folder contains React context providers and other provider components.
Use this folder for components that wrap your application or parts of it to provide context or other functionality.

## Organization Guidelines

- Create separate files for each provider type
- Use descriptive names: `theme-provider.tsx`, `auth-provider.tsx`, `query-provider.tsx`
- Group related providers together if they share similar concerns
- Consider creating a root provider that combines multiple providers if needed
