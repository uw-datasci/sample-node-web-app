# Utility Functions

This folder contains utility functions and helper methods.
Use this folder for reusable utility functions that don't depend on React or specific business logic.

## Organization Guidelines

- Organize by utility type or category
- Create separate files for different utility categories: `date.ts`, `string.ts`, `validation.ts`, `formatting.ts`
- Group related utility functions in the same file
- Use descriptive file names that indicate the utility category
- Keep utilities pure and framework-agnostic when possible
