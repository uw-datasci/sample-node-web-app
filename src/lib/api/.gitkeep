# API Client

This folder contains API client functions and API-related utilities.
Use this folder for functions that make HTTP requests, handle API responses, and manage API communication.

## Organization Guidelines

- Organize by resource or endpoint group
- Create separate files for each API resource: `users.ts`, `products.ts`, `auth.ts`
- Group related API calls in the same file
- Keep API client configuration and interceptors in separate files if needed
