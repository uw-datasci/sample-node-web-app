# Repositories

This folder contains data access layer code (repositories) for database operations.
Use this folder for code that handles direct database queries, data fetching, and persistence logic.

## Organization Guidelines

- Create separate files for each entity or resource
- Use descriptive names: `user-repository.ts`, `product-repository.ts`, `order-repository.ts`
- Each repository should handle CRUD operations for a single entity type
- Group related repository methods in the same file
- Keep repositories focused on data access only, not business logic
