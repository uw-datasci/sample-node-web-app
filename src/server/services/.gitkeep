# Server Services

This folder contains server-side business logic services.
Use this folder for services that handle core business logic, data processing, and orchestration.

## Organization Guidelines

- Create separate files for each business domain or feature
- Use descriptive names: `user-service.ts`, `order-service.ts`, `payment-service.ts`
- Group related service methods in the same file
- Services should orchestrate between repositories and handle business rules
- Keep services focused on a single domain or feature area
