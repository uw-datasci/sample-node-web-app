# Server Configuration

This folder contains server-side configuration files and setup.
Use this folder for configuration files, environment setup, and server initialization code.

## Organization Guidelines

- Create separate files for different configuration concerns
- Common files: `database.ts` (DB config), `env.ts` (environment variables), `constants.ts` (app constants)
- Keep configuration files focused and single-purpose
- Use index files to export all configuration for centralized access
